# ProcessWire AI Workflows

> [!WARNING]  
> This project is experimental and for demonstration purposes only.

This project ~~is~~ **will be** a collection of [OpenCode][2] Agents, Rules, Skills, and workflows for [ProcessWire CMS][1] development and general web development.

## What is ProcessWire CMS?

ProcessWire is a flexible and powerful content management system (CMS) that provides developers with a robust platform for building custom websites and applications. It emphasizes simplicity, flexibility, and developer-friendly APIs.

## What is OpenCode?

OpenCode is an open-source AI workflow platform that lets teams compose agents, skills, and automation rules into end-to-end solutions. It focuses on reusable building blocks, transparent governance, and rapid iteration so developers can prototype and ship intelligent assistants quickly.
